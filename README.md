## Getting Started

To get started with Gooogle Maps Clone locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/liu-purnomo/google-map-clone.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd google-map-clone
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Register for a Maps API via Google Cloud

   - Create a `.env.local` / `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Register for a Maps JavaScript API key via the Google Cloud platform and enable the GeoCoding API. You can follow the official documentation to obtain the API key.
   - Open the `.env.local` file and add the following line:

     ```env
     VITE_REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```

     Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key you obtained from Google Cloud. By setting up the .env.local file with the appropriate API key, the application will be able to access the geocoding API and provide accurate property locations.

4. Start the development server:

   ```javascript
   npm run start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit specified local host port to view the app eg. `http://localhost:8080`
